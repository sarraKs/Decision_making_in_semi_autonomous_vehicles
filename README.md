# Decision-making unit for semi-autonomous vehicles

This research focuses on developing a decision-making unit for semi-autonomous vehicles, tasked with seamlessly transitioning from automated driving to teleoperated mode. The unit aims to make optimal switching decisions by assessing the global uncertainty derived from sensor measurements. To achieve this, various machine learning models were trained and tested using datasets generated by the Matlab Autonomous Driving toolbox.
